# Handiest
A MelonLoader mod for PLAYA VR to load funscripts


Currently WIP.


Can be used by using the MelonLoader installer, installing the mod dll, booting PLAYA VR, shutting it down, editing handiest.json's handy key entry with your handy key, and picking a local file with a funscript.


Designed to work with local files, remote files (Sitename-id.funscript in the scripts folder set in the config), and webservers (webservers can provide a funscript entry in their video json entry, not currently used by any webserver).


Currently only works on windows, quest support is planned, but MelonLoader Quest support is experimental, so maybe not.
